                <h2>BSIT Student</h2>
                <p>I am Elbert Cahanap a first year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student in Bukidnon State University, my section code is BSIT1-C. Born on April 27, 2003 I'm 20 years of age.I live in Purok 17 Casisang, Malaybalay City Bukidnon, Philippines. I consider myself a bit reserved, and some may mistake me for an introverted person. However, I am simply shy, especially when interacting with people I don't know. I tend to be more outgoing and loud when surrounded by friends. Despite my shy nature, I am approachable, and if you ever have any concerns, please feel free to contact me.  In one word, I would describe myself as a dilettante. I am inherently curious about everything, and I enjoy engaging in activities that both amaze me and challenge me to work hard to master new skills.</p>

                  <p>Playing the guitar can reduce my stress and help me enjoy the present. Every time I feel down or depressed, I play the guitar because it helps me forget the problems I face. However, it's not just during sad moments that I play the guitar; I also play when I am happy. The emotions I experience while playing the guitar contribute to my performance. That is why I love playing the guitar.</p>

                  <p>Not only is Karate a form of self-defense, but it is also a combat sport that can help you build friendships with strangers.

Sharing pain with each other fosters a sense of brotherhood.</p>
